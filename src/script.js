According to all known laws
of aviation,<br><br>  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.<br><br>  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.<br><br>  
The bee, of course, flies anyway<br><br>  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.<br><br>  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br><br>  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.<br><br>  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!<br><br>  
Ooming!<br><br>  
Hang on a second.<br><br>  
Hello?<br><br>  
- Barry?
- Adam?<br><br>  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.<br><br>  
Looking sharp.<br><br>  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.<br><br>  
Sorry. I'm excited.<br><br>  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.<br><br>  
A perfect report card, all B's.<br><br>  
Very proud.<br><br>  
Ma! I got a thing going here.<br><br>  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!<br><br>  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!<br><br>  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!<br><br>  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.<br><br>  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.<br><br>  
Never thought I'd make it.<br><br>  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.<br><br>  
Those were awkward.<br><br>  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.<br><br>  
You did come back different.<br><br>  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.<br><br>  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.<br><br>  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.<br><br>  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.<br><br>  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.<br><br>  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.<br><br>  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.<br><br>  
That's why we don't need vacations.<br><br>  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.<br><br>  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!<br><br>  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!<br><br>  
Hallelujah!<br><br>  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,<br><br>  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.<br><br>  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...<br><br>  
...9:15.<br><br>  
That concludes our ceremonies.<br><br>  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!<br><br>  
Will we pick ourjob today?<br><br>  
I heard it's just orientation.<br><br>  
Heads up! Here we go.<br><br>  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.<br><br>  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.<br><br>  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco<br><br>  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.<br><br>  
This is it!<br><br>  
Wow.<br><br>  
Wow.<br><br>  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life<br><br>  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.<br><br>  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.<br><br>  
Our top-secret formula<br><br>  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured<br><br>  
into this soothing sweet syrup<br><br>  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...<br><br>  
Honey!<br><br>  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!<br><br>  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.<br><br>  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive<br><br>  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.<br><br>  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.<br><br>  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.<br><br>  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.<br><br>  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey<br><br>  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.<br><br>  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?<br><br>  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know<br><br>  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.<br><br>  
But choose carefully<br><br>  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.<br><br>  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.<br><br>  
What's the difference?<br><br>  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off<br><br>  
in 27 million years.<br><br>  
So you'll just work us to death?<br><br>  
We'll sure try.<br><br>  
Wow! That blew my mind!<br><br>  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?<br><br>  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.<br><br>  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.<br><br>  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?<br><br>  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.<br><br>  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.<br><br>  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?<br><br>  
Like what? Give me one example.<br><br>  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.<br><br>  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.<br><br>  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.<br><br>  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.<br><br>  
I've never seen them this close.<br><br>  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.<br><br>  
Yeah, but some don't come back.<br><br>  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!<br><br>  
You guys did great!<br><br>  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!<br><br>  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.<br><br>  
Their day's not planned.<br><br>  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.<br><br>  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.<br><br>  
Right.<br><br>  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.<br><br>  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.<br><br>  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.<br><br>  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?<br><br>  
Distant. Distant.<br><br>  
Look at these two.<br><br>  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.<br><br>  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.<br><br>  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!<br><br>  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!<br><br>  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.<br><br>  
What were you doing during this?<br><br>  
Trying to alert the authorities.<br><br>  
I can autograph that.<br><br>  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?<br><br>  
Yeah. Gusty.<br><br>  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.<br><br>  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!<br><br>  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.<br><br>  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!<br><br>  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.<br><br>  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?<br><br>  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.<br><br>  
Hey, Honex!<br><br>  
Dad, you surprised me.<br><br>  
You decide what you're interested in?<br><br>  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.<br><br>  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?<br><br>  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.<br><br>  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.<br><br>  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.<br><br>  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,<br><br>  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.<br><br>  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?<br><br>  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.<br><br>  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!<br><br>  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.<br><br>  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!<br><br>  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!<br><br>  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.<br><br>  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!<br><br>  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!<br><br>  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.<br><br>  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!<br><br>  
I'm so proud.<br><br>  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.<br><br>  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.<br><br>  
Yeah, right.<br><br>  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...<br><br>  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!<br><br>  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.<br><br>  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!<br><br>  
Wow!<br><br>  
Oouple of newbies?<br><br>  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!<br><br>  
Make your choice.<br><br>  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.<br><br>  
Oh, my. What's available?<br><br>  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.<br><br>  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.<br><br>  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.<br><br>  
Wax monkey's always open.<br><br>  
The Krelman opened up again.<br><br>  
What happened?<br><br>  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.<br><br>  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.<br><br>  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!<br><br>  
Oh, this is so hard!<br><br>  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,<br><br>  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,<br><br>  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?<br><br>  
Barry!<br><br>  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...<br><br>  
What happened to you?
Where are you?<br><br>  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?<br><br>  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!<br><br>  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.<br><br>  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?<br><br>  
Another call coming in.<br><br>  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd<br><br>  
that gets their roses today.<br><br>  
Hey, guys.<br><br>  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?<br><br>  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.<br><br>  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.<br><br>  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?<br><br>  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.<br><br>  
- Thank you.
- OK.<br><br>  
You got a rain advisory today,<br><br>  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.<br><br>  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,<br><br>  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.<br><br>  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.<br><br>  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!<br><br>  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,<br><br>  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!<br><br>  
All right, launch positions!<br><br>  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!<br><br>  
Black and yellow!<br><br>  
Hello!<br><br>  
You ready for this, hot shot?<br><br>  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.<br><br>  
Wind, check.<br><br>  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.<br><br>  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.<br><br>  
Scared out of my shorts, check.<br><br>  
OK, ladies,<br><br>  
let's move it out!<br><br>  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!<br><br>  
All of you, drain those flowers!<br><br>  
Wow! I'm out!<br><br>  
I can't believe I'm out!<br><br>  
So blue.<br><br>  
I feel so fast and free!<br><br>  
Box kite!<br><br>  
Wow!<br><br>  
Flowers!<br><br>  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.<br><br>  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.<br><br>  
Roses!<br><br>  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.<br><br>  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.<br><br>  
That is one nectar collector!<br><br>  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.<br><br>  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,<br><br>  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.<br><br>  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?<br><br>  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.<br><br>  
Oool.<br><br>  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?<br><br>  
Oopy that visual.<br><br>  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.<br><br>  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?<br><br>  
Affirmative.<br><br>  
That was on the line!<br><br>  
This is the coolest. What is it?<br><br>  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.<br><br>  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.<br><br>  
Yeah, fuzzy.<br><br>  
Ohemical-y.<br><br>  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.<br><br>  
My sweet lord of bees!<br><br>  
Oandy-brain, get off there!<br><br>  
Problem!<br><br>  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.<br><br>  
Affirmative.<br><br>  
Very close.<br><br>  
Gonna hurt.<br><br>  
Mama's little boy.<br><br>  
You are way out of position, rookie!<br><br>  
Ooming in at you like a missile!<br><br>  
Help me!<br><br>  
I don't think these are flowers.<br><br>  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.<br><br>  
What is this?!<br><br>  
Match point!<br><br>  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!<br><br>  
Yowser!<br><br>  
Gross.<br><br>  
There's a bee in the car!<br><br>  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!<br><br>  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!<br><br>  
He's going to sting me!<br><br>  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!<br><br>  
He blinked!<br><br>  
Spray him, Granny!<br><br>  
What are you doing?!<br><br>  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.<br><br>  
I gotta get home.<br><br>  
Oan't fly in rain.<br><br>  
Oan't fly in rain.<br><br>  
Oan't fly in rain.<br><br>  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!<br><br>  
Ken, could you close
the window please?<br><br>  
Ken, could you close
the window please?<br><br>  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.<br><br>  
You see? Folds out.<br><br>  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.<br><br>  
What was that?<br><br>  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...<br><br>  
Drapes!<br><br>  
That is diabolical.<br><br>  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.<br><br>  
What's number one? Star Wars?<br><br>  
Nah, I don't go for that...<br><br>  
...kind of stuff.<br><br>  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.<br><br>  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.<br><br>  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.<br><br>  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.<br><br>  
I predicted global warming.<br><br>  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.<br><br>  
Wait! Stop! Bee!<br><br>  
Stand back. These are winter boots.<br><br>  
Wait!<br><br>  
Don't kill him!<br><br>  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!<br><br>  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?<br><br>  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?<br><br>  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.<br><br>  
My brochure!<br><br>  
There you go, little guy.<br><br>  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.<br><br>  
Put that on your resume brochure.<br><br>  
My whole face could puff up.<br><br>  
Make it one of your special skills.<br><br>  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.<br><br>  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.<br><br>  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.<br><br>  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.<br><br>  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.<br><br>  
I gotta say something.<br><br>  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.<br><br>  
All right, here it goes.<br><br>  
Nah.<br><br>  
What would I say?<br><br>  
I could really get in trouble.<br><br>  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.<br><br>  
I can't believe I'm doing this.<br><br>  
I've got to.<br><br>  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!<br><br>  
No. Yes. No.<br><br>  
Do it. I can't.<br><br>  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.<br><br>  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!<br><br>  
Hi!<br><br>  
I'm sorry.<br><br>  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.<br><br>  
You're talking!<br><br>  
I'm so sorry.<br><br>  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.<br><br>  
But I don't recall going to bed.<br><br>  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.<br><br>  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!<br><br>  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,<br><br>  
but they were all trying to kill me.<br><br>  
And if it wasn't for you...<br><br>  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.<br><br>  
That was a little weird.<br><br>  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.<br><br>  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!<br><br>  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.<br><br>  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?<br><br>  
The talking thing.<br><br>  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.<br><br>  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.<br><br>  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.<br><br>  
Anyway...<br><br>  
Oan I...<br><br>  
...get you something?
- Like what?<br><br>  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?<br><br>  
I don't want to put you out.<br><br>  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.<br><br>  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.<br><br>  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.<br><br>  
Hey, you want rum cake?<br><br>  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.<br><br>  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!<br><br>  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.<br><br>  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.<br><br>  
You look great!<br><br>  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.<br><br>  
Are you all right?<br><br>  
No.<br><br>  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.<br><br>  
He finally gets there.<br><br>  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.<br><br>  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.<br><br>  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"<br><br>  
Is that a bee joke?<br><br>  
That's the kind of stuff we do.<br><br>  
Yeah, different.<br><br>  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?<br><br>  
About work? I don't know.<br><br>  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.<br><br>  
I know how you feel.<br><br>  
- You do?
- Sure.<br><br>  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.<br><br>  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.<br><br>  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.<br><br>  
Anyway, if you look...<br><br>  
There's my hive right there. See it?<br><br>  
You're in Sheep Meadow!<br><br>  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!<br><br>  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.<br><br>  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?<br><br>  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.<br><br>  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.<br><br>  
Just having two cups of coffee!<br><br>  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.<br><br>  
Yeah, it's no trouble.<br><br>  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.<br><br>  
Are you...?<br><br>  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?<br><br>  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.<br><br>  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.<br><br>  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.<br><br>  
Or not.<br><br>  
OK, Barry.<br><br>  
And thank you
so much again... for before.<br><br>  
Oh, that? That was nothing.<br><br>  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...<br><br>  
This can't possibly work.<br><br>  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.<br><br>  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.<br><br>  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!<br><br>  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.<br><br>  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!<br><br>  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?<br><br>  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.<br><br>  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.<br><br>  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.<br><br>  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.<br><br>  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.<br><br>  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.<br><br>  
- Well...
- Well?<br><br>  
Well, I met someone.<br><br>  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?<br><br>  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.<br><br>  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.<br><br>  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.<br><br>  
I can't get by that face.<br><br>  
So who is she?<br><br>  
She's... human.<br><br>  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.<br><br>  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.<br><br>  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!<br><br>  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!<br><br>  
We're not dating.<br><br>  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes<br><br>  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!<br><br>  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.<br><br>  
This is over!<br><br>  
Eat this.<br><br>  
This is not over! What was that?<br><br>  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!<br><br>  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!<br><br>  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.<br><br>  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...<br><br>  
Sit down!<br><br>  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!<br><br>  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!<br><br>  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?<br><br>  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!<br><br>  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!<br><br>  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.<br><br>  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br><br>  
There he is. He's in the pool.<br><br>  
You know what your problem is, Barry?<br><br>  
I gotta start thinking bee?<br><br>  
How much longer will this go on?<br><br>  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?<br><br>  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.<br><br>  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!<br><br>  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?<br><br>  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.<br><br>  
Martin, would you talk to him?<br><br>  
Barry, I'm talking to you!<br><br>  
You coming?<br><br>  
Got everything?<br><br>  
All set!<br><br>  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.<br><br>  
Don't be too long.<br><br>  
Watch this!<br><br>  
Vanessa!<br><br>  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.<br><br>  
He doesn't respond to yelling!<br><br>  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!<br><br>  
I'm not listening to this.<br><br>  
Sorry, I've gotta go.<br><br>  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.<br><br>  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?<br><br>  
Bye.<br><br>  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.<br><br>  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?<br><br>  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!<br><br>  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.<br><br>  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?<br><br>  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?<br><br>  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.<br><br>  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.<br><br>  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!<br><br>  
You don't have that?<br><br>  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.<br><br>  
Oh, my.<br><br>  
Dumb bees!<br><br>  
You must want to sting all those jerks.<br><br>  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.<br><br>  
So you have to watch your temper.<br><br>  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,<br><br>  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:<br><br>  
Anger, jealousy, lust.<br><br>  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?<br><br>  
Yeah.<br><br>  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.<br><br>  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!<br><br>  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?<br><br>  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?<br><br>  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.<br><br>  
You've really got that
down to a science.<br><br>  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.<br><br>  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?<br><br>  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,<br><br>  
Ray Liotta Private Select?<br><br>  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.<br><br>  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.<br><br>  
You don't have
enough food of your own?<br><br>  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?<br><br>  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!<br><br>  
And it's hard to make it!<br><br>  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!<br><br>  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!<br><br>  
It's just honey, Barry.<br><br>  
Just what?!<br><br>  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!<br><br>  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!<br><br>  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.<br><br>  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!<br><br>  
Hey, Hector.<br><br>  
- You almost done?
- Almost.<br><br>  
He is here. I sense it.<br><br>  
Well, I guess I'll go home now<br><br>  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.<br><br>  
You're busted, box boy!<br><br>  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!<br><br>  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!<br><br>  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?<br><br>  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.<br><br>  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!<br><br>  
You're too late! It's ours now!<br><br>  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!<br><br>  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!<br><br>  
Where is the honey coming from?<br><br>  
Tell me where!<br><br>  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!<br><br>  
Orazy person!<br><br>  
What horrible thing has happened here?<br><br>  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now<br><br>  
they're on the road to nowhere!<br><br>  
Just keep still.<br><br>  
What? You're not dead?<br><br>  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?<br><br>  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.<br><br>  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!<br><br>  
I'm going to Tacoma.<br><br>  
- And you?
- He really is dead.<br><br>  
All right.<br><br>  
Uh-oh!<br><br>  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!<br><br>  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?<br><br>  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!<br><br>  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!<br><br>  
How much do you people need to see?!<br><br>  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!<br><br>  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.<br><br>  
But don't kill no more bugs!<br><br>  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!<br><br>  
- You hear something?
- Like what?<br><br>  
Like tiny screaming.<br><br>  
Turn off the radio.<br><br>  
Whassup, bee boy?<br><br>  
Hey, Blood.<br><br>  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.<br><br>  
Wow!<br><br>  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.<br><br>  
I mean, that honey's ours.<br><br>  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.<br><br>  
It's a close community.<br><br>  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.<br><br>  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.<br><br>  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!<br><br>  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.<br><br>  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.<br><br>  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.<br><br>  
You got to be kidding me!<br><br>  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!<br><br>  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!<br><br>  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?<br><br>  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.<br><br>  
What is this place?<br><br>  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.<br><br>  
They are pinheads!<br><br>  
Pinhead.<br><br>  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.<br><br>  
The Thomas 3000!<br><br>  
Smoker?<br><br>  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.<br><br>  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.<br><br>  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.<br><br>  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?<br><br>  
Oh, my!<br><br>  
What's going on? Are you OK?<br><br>  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.<br><br>  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?<br><br>  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.<br><br>  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!<br><br>  
That's a drag queen!<br><br>  
What is this?<br><br>  
Oh, no!<br><br>  
There's hundreds of them!<br><br>  
Bee honey.<br><br>  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!<br><br>  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.<br><br>  
Oh, Barry, stop.<br><br>  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.<br><br>  
Do these look like rumors?<br><br>  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.<br><br>  
How did you get mixed up in this?<br><br>  
He's been talking to humans.<br><br>  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!<br><br>  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!<br><br>  
Make out? Barry!<br><br>  
We do not.<br><br>  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?<br><br>  
The bees!<br><br>  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.<br><br>  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?<br><br>  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!<br><br>  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked<br><br>  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.<br><br>  
I remember that.<br><br>  
What right do they have to our honey?<br><br>  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!<br><br>  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?<br><br>  
Sting them where it really hurts.<br><br>  
In the face! The eye!<br><br>  
- That would hurt.
- No.<br><br>  
Up the nose? That's a killer.<br><br>  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.<br><br>  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.<br><br>  
No more bee beards!<br><br>  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.<br><br>  
Weather with Storm Stinger.<br><br>  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.<br><br>

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,<br><br>  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,<br><br>  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!<br><br>  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,<br><br>  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,<br><br>  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.<br><br>  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.<br><br>  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?<br><br>  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.<br><br>  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?<br><br>  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.<br><br>  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.<br><br>  
How old are you?<br><br>  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,<br><br>  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.<br><br>  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.<br><br>  
It's a common name. Next week...<br><br>  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...<br><br>  
Next week...<br><br>  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.<br><br>  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.<br><br>  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.<br><br>  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!<br><br>  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.<br><br>  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?<br><br>  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.<br><br>  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!<br><br>  
I'm helping him sue the human race.<br><br>  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.<br><br>  
This is Ken.<br><br>  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.<br><br>  
Why does he talk again?<br><br>  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.<br><br>  
But it's our yogurt night!<br><br>  
Bye-bye.<br><br>  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!<br><br>  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!<br><br>  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.<br><br>  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?<br><br>  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.<br><br>  
So why are you helping me?<br><br>  
Bees have good qualities.<br><br>  
And it takes my mind off the shop.<br><br>  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.<br><br>  
Those are great, if you're three.<br><br>  
And artificial flowers.<br><br>  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.<br><br>  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.<br><br>  
Bees must hate those fake things!<br><br>  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.<br><br>  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.<br><br>  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.<br><br>  
You sure you want to go through with it?<br><br>  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able<br><br>  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!<br><br>  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,<br><br>  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,<br><br>  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.<br><br>  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?<br><br>  
It's pretty big, isn't it?<br><br>  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.<br><br>  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?<br><br>  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.<br><br>  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.<br><br>  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.<br><br>  
You boys work on this?<br><br>  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.<br><br>  
All right. Oase number 4475,<br><br>  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry<br><br>  
is now in session.<br><br>  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?<br><br>  
A privilege.<br><br>  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?<br><br>  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.<br><br>  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.<br><br>  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<br><br>  
my grandmother was a simple woman.<br><br>  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right<br><br>  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.<br><br>  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,<br><br>  
just think of what would it mean.<br><br>  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm<br><br>  
for the elastic in my britches!<br><br>  
Talking bee!<br><br>  
How do we know this isn't some sort of<br><br>  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?<br><br>  
They could be using laser beams!<br><br>  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,<br><br>  
he could be on steroids!<br><br>  
Mr. Benson?<br><br>  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.<br><br>  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.<br><br>  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!<br><br>  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.<br><br>  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room<br><br>  
who think they can take it from us<br><br>  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,<br><br>  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have<br><br>  
but everything we are!<br><br>  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!<br><br>  
Oall your first witness.<br><br>  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.<br><br>  
I suppose so.<br><br>  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!<br><br>  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.<br><br>  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.<br><br>  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?<br><br>  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.<br><br>  
- No.
- No.<br><br>  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,<br><br>  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.<br><br>  
They're very lovable creatures.<br><br>  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.<br><br>  
You mean like this?<br><br>  
Bears kill bees!<br><br>  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!<br><br>  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!<br><br>  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.<br><br>  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.<br><br>  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.<br><br>  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?<br><br>  
No, I haven't.<br><br>  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example<br><br>  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human<br><br>  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.<br><br>  
Oh, please.<br><br>  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?<br><br>  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.<br><br>  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!<br><br>  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!<br><br>  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on<br><br>  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.<br><br>  
Thank you. Thank you.<br><br>  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome<br><br>  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.<br><br>  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?<br><br>  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?<br><br>  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't<br><br>  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?<br><br>  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!<br><br>  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!<br><br>  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!<br><br>  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!<br><br>  
Order! Order, I say!<br><br>  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!<br><br>  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.<br><br>  
I think the jury's on our side.<br><br>  
Are we doing everything right, legally?<br><br>  
I'm a florist.<br><br>  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.<br><br>  
To a great team!<br><br>  
Well, hello.<br><br>  
- Ken!
- Hello.<br><br>  
I didn't think you were coming.<br><br>  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.<br><br>  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.<br><br>  
Oh, that was lucky.<br><br>  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.<br><br>  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.<br><br>  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.<br><br>  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.<br><br>  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.<br><br>  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,<br><br>  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.<br><br>  
You think I don't see what you're doing?<br><br>  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.<br><br>  
Do we?<br><br>  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.<br><br>  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.<br><br>  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.<br><br>  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.<br><br>  
Yeah, you do that.<br><br>  
Look at that.<br><br>  
You know, I've just about had it<br><br>  
with your little mind games.<br><br>  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.<br><br>  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.<br><br>  
A lot of ads.<br><br>  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?<br><br>  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!<br><br>  
I think something stinks in here!<br><br>  
I love the smell of flowers.<br><br>  
How do you like the smell of flames?!<br><br>  
Not as much.<br><br>  
Water bug! Not taking sides!<br><br>  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!<br><br>  
I've got issues!<br><br>  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!<br><br>  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?<br><br>  
Surf's up, dude!<br><br>  
Poo water!<br><br>  
That bowl is gnarly.<br><br>  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!<br><br>  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!<br><br>  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!<br><br>  
We need to talk!<br><br>  
He's just a little bee!<br><br>  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!<br><br>  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?<br><br>  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!<br><br>  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...<br><br>  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!<br><br>  
Goodbye, Ken.<br><br>  
And for your information,<br><br>  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!<br><br>  
I'm sorry about all that.<br><br>  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!<br><br>  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.<br><br>  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.<br><br>  
Are you OK for the trial?<br><br>  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.<br><br>  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.<br><br>  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...<br><br>  
Yeah.<br><br>  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic<br><br>  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.<br><br>  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around<br><br>  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.<br><br>  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?<br><br>  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.<br><br>  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.<br><br>  
What exactly is your relationship<br><br>  
to that woman?<br><br>  
We're friends.<br><br>  
- Good friends?
- Yes.<br><br>  
How good? Do you live together?<br><br>  
Wait a minute...<br><br>  
Are you her little...<br><br>  
...bedbug?<br><br>  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,<br><br>  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?<br><br>  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!<br><br>  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!<br><br>  
Hold me back!<br><br>  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?<br><br>  
He's denouncing bees!<br><br>  
Don't y'all date your cousins?<br><br>  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!<br><br>  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!<br><br>  
Oh, I'm hit!!<br><br>  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!<br><br>  
Order! Order!<br><br>  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!<br><br>  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!<br><br>  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!<br><br>  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!<br><br>  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.<br><br>  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison<br><br>  
from my heaving buttocks?<br><br>  
I will have order in this court. Order!<br><br>  
Order, please!<br><br>  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race<br><br>  
took a pointed turn against the bees<br><br>  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.<br><br>  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.<br><br>  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.<br><br>  
I...<br><br>  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?<br><br>  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.<br><br>  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.<br><br>  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.<br><br>  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.<br><br>  
What was it like to sting someone?<br><br>  
I can't explain it. It was all...<br><br>  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!<br><br>  
All right.<br><br>  
You think it was all a trap?<br><br>  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.<br><br>  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.<br><br>  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?<br><br>  
I don't know.<br><br>  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.<br><br>  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!<br><br>  
Oh, my.<br><br>  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?<br><br>  
- Why?
- The smoke.<br><br>  
Bees don't smoke.<br><br>  
Right. Bees don't smoke.<br><br>  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.<br><br>  
That's it! That's our case!<br><br>  
It is? It's not over?<br><br>  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.<br><br>  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.<br><br>  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.<br><br>  
Mr. Flayman.<br><br>  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!<br><br>  
Where is the rest of your team?<br><br>  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.<br><br>  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,<br><br>  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.<br><br>  
I actually heard a funny story about...<br><br>  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs<br><br>  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?<br><br>  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?<br><br>  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges<br><br>  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.<br><br>  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!<br><br>  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going<br><br>  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.<br><br>  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.<br><br>  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?<br><br>  
Show me the smoking gun!<br><br>  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?<br><br>  
Here is your smoking gun.<br><br>  
What is that?<br><br>  
It's a bee smoker!<br><br>  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?<br><br>  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.<br><br>  
Look at what has happened<br><br>  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"<br><br>  
Is this what nature intended for us?<br><br>  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines<br><br>  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?<br><br>  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?<br><br>  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.<br><br>  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!<br><br>  
Free the bees! Free the bees!<br><br>  
Free the bees!<br><br>  
Free the bees! Free the bees!<br><br>  
The court finds in favor of the bees!<br><br>  
Vanessa, we won!<br><br>  
I knew you could do it! High-five!<br><br>  
Sorry.<br><br>  
I'm OK! You know what this means?<br><br>  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.<br><br>  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.<br><br>  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.<br><br>  
You'll regret this.<br><br>  
Barry, how much honey is out there?<br><br>  
All right. One at a time.<br><br>  
Barry, who are you wearing?<br><br>  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.<br><br>  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?<br><br>  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.<br><br>  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?<br><br>  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.<br><br>  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,<br><br>  
every last drop.<br><br>  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more<br><br>  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.<br><br>  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.<br><br>  
Wait for my signal.<br><br>  
Take him out.<br><br>  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.<br><br>  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...<br><br>  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!<br><br>  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products<br><br>  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.<br><br>  
Oan't breathe.<br><br>  
Bring it in, boys!<br><br>  
Hold it right there! Good.<br><br>  
Tap it.<br><br>  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!<br><br>  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.<br><br>  
Shut down honey production!<br><br>  
Stop making honey!<br><br>  
Turn your key, sir!<br><br>  
What do we do now?<br><br>  
Oannonball!<br><br>  
We're shutting honey production!<br><br>  
Mission abort.<br><br>  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.<br><br>  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.<br><br>  
Oh, yeah?<br><br>  
What's going on? Where is everybody?<br><br>  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.<br><br>  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.<br><br>  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.<br><br>  
At least we got our honey back.<br><br>  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?<br><br>  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.<br><br>  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.<br><br>  
And now...<br><br>  
Now I can't.<br><br>  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.<br><br>  
I thought their lives would be better!<br><br>  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.<br><br>  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?<br><br>  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.<br><br>  
What happened here?<br><br>  
That is not the half of it.<br><br>  
Oh, no. Oh, my.<br><br>  
They're all wilting.<br><br>  
Doesn't look very good, does it?<br><br>  
No.<br><br>  
And whose fault do you think that is?<br><br>  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.<br><br>  
Bees?<br><br>  
Specifically, me.<br><br>  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.<br><br>  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.<br><br>  
That's our whole SAT test right there.<br><br>  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.<br><br>  
And then, of course...<br><br>  
The human species?<br><br>  
So if there's no more pollination,<br><br>  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?<br><br>  
I know this is also partly my fault.<br><br>  
How about a suicide pact?<br><br>  
How do we do it?<br><br>  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.<br><br>  
Right, right.<br><br>  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.<br><br>  
I had to open my mouth and talk.<br><br>  
Vanessa?<br><br>  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?<br><br>  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.<br><br>  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.<br><br>  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.<br><br>  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.<br><br>  
I know. Me neither.<br><br>  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.<br><br>  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?<br><br>  
Roses!<br><br>  
Vanessa!<br><br>  
Roses?!<br><br>  
Barry?<br><br>  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.<br><br>  
Flowers, bees, pollen!<br><br>  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.<br><br>  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?<br><br>  
Oould you slow down?<br><br>  
Barry!<br><br>  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.<br><br>  
Yes, it kind of is.<br><br>  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you<br><br>  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.<br><br>  
Actually, it's completely closed down.<br><br>  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.<br><br>  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.<br><br>  
I don't want to hear it!<br><br>  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.<br><br>  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.<br><br>  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.<br><br>  
- Bees.
- Park.<br><br>  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.<br><br>  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!<br><br>  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.<br><br>  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.<br><br>  
Security will be tight.<br><br>  
I have an idea.<br><br>  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.<br><br>  
Official floral business. It's real.<br><br>  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.<br><br>  
Thank you. It was a gift.<br><br>  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.<br><br>  
How about The Princess and the Pea?<br><br>  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!<br><br>  
Yes, I got it.<br><br>  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?<br><br>  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?<br><br>  
It goes under the mattresses.<br><br>  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.<br><br>  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!<br><br>  
Let's see what this baby'll do.<br><br>  
Hey, what are you doing?!<br><br>  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...<br><br>  
...without arousing suspicion.<br><br>  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.<br><br>  
Stop! Security.<br><br>  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.<br><br>  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?<br><br>  
Would you remove your shoes?<br><br>  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.<br><br>  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.<br><br>  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.<br><br>  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!<br><br>  
I think this is gonna work.<br><br>  
It's got to work.<br><br>  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.<br><br>  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.<br><br>  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.<br><br>  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.<br><br>  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.<br><br>  
Be careful.<br><br>  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?<br><br>  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.<br><br>  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.<br><br>  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.<br><br>  
Bee!<br><br>  
Don't freak out! My entire species...<br><br>  
What are you doing?<br><br>  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?<br><br>  
Don't move.<br><br>  
Oh, Barry.<br><br>  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.<br><br>  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?<br><br>  
And please hurry!<br><br>  
What happened here?<br><br>  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.<br><br>  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!<br><br>  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!<br><br>  
No one's flying the plane!<br><br>  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?<br><br>  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.<br><br>  
Where's the pilot?<br><br>  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.<br><br>  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?<br><br>  
As a matter of fact, there is.<br><br>  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.<br><br>  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.<br><br>  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.<br><br>  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.<br><br>  
I can't fly a plane.<br><br>  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.<br><br>  
How hard could it be?<br><br>  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.<br><br>  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,<br><br>  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.<br><br>  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...<br><br>  
That's Barry!<br><br>  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers<br><br>  
and an incapacitated flight crew.<br><br>  
Flowers?!<br><br>  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls<br><br>  
with absolutely no flight experience.<br><br>  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.<br><br>  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.<br><br>  
They've done enough damage.<br><br>  
But isn't he your only hope?<br><br>  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.<br><br>  
Their wings are too small...<br><br>  
Haven't we heard this a million times?<br><br>  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."<br><br>  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.<br><br>  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.<br><br>  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.<br><br>  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.<br><br>  
But let me tell you about a small job.<br><br>  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.<br><br>  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.<br><br>  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.<br><br>  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.<br><br>  
We get behind a fellow.<br><br>  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!<br><br>  
Left, right, down, hover.<br><br>  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.<br><br>  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!<br><br>  
Barry, what happened?!<br><br>  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.<br><br>  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!<br><br>  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.<br><br>  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!<br><br>  
Move out!<br><br>  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!<br><br>  
Don't have to yell.<br><br>  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.<br><br>  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!<br><br>  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!<br><br>  
I can't do this!<br><br>  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!<br><br>  
You snap out of it.<br><br>  
You snap out of it.<br><br>  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!<br><br>  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!<br><br>  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!<br><br>  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.<br><br>  
How is the plane flying?<br><br>  
I don't know.<br><br>  
Hello?<br><br>  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?<br><br>  
The Pollen Jocks!<br><br>  
They do get behind a fellow.<br><br>  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.<br><br>  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.<br><br>  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?<br><br>  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.<br><br>  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.<br><br>  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.<br><br>  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br><br>  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.<br><br>  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.<br><br>  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.<br><br>  
Bring the nose down.<br><br>  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br><br>  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!<br><br>  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br><br>  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.<br><br>  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?<br><br>  
Affirmative!<br><br>  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.<br><br>  
Land on that flower!<br><br>  
Ready? Full reverse!<br><br>  
Spin it around!<br><br>  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?<br><br>  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!<br><br>  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower<br><br>  
made of millions of bees!<br><br>  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.<br><br>  
Rotate around it.<br><br>  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.<br><br>  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?<br><br>  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!<br><br>  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.<br><br>  
Aim for the center!<br><br>  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!<br><br>  
Oome on, already.<br><br>  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!<br><br>  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.<br><br>  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?<br><br>  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!<br><br>  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.<br><br>  
Listen, everyone!<br><br>  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen<br><br>  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.<br><br>  
That means this is our last chance.<br><br>  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.<br><br>  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?<br><br>  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?<br><br>  
We're bees!<br><br>  
Keychain!<br><br>  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.<br><br>  
Hold on, Barry. Here.<br><br>  
You've earned this.<br><br>  
Yeah!<br><br>  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.<br><br>  
Oh, yeah.<br><br>  
That's our Barry.<br><br>  
Mom! The bees are back!<br><br>  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.<br><br>  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!<br><br>  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?<br><br>  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.<br><br>  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!<br><br>  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!<br><br>  
I had no idea.<br><br>  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?<br><br>  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.<br><br>  
Sorry I'm late.<br><br>  
He's a lawyer too?<br><br>  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.<br><br>  
Have a great afternoon!<br><br>  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.<br><br>  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.<br><br>  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?<br><br>  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.<br><br>  
Thank you, Barry!<br><br>  
That bee is living my life!<br><br>  
Let it go, Kenny.<br><br>  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.<br><br>  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.<br><br>  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.<br><br>  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.<br><br>  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?<br><br>  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.<br><br>  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?<br><br>  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!<br><br>  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.<br><br>  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.`
